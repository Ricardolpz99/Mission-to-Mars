# Mission to Mars 
## Overview of Project
Robin, an astronomy lover has asked us for help to make a web application. For this, we will rely on BeautifulSoup and Splinter to extract the latest news from the official NASA site, images related to Mars, a comparative table of Mars with the Earth and finally images of the hemispheres of the red planet.
Since the information comes from various places, we will use Mongo to store all this information. Finally, it will be formatted using Bootstrap 3, this is because Robin wants to work for NASA, so her web application must be well presented.
